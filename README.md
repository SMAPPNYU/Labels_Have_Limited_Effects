#Abstract: 
As the primary arena for viral misinformation shifts toward transnational threats such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the search continues for scalable, lasting countermeasures compatible with principles of transparency and free expression. To inform future interventions, we conducted a randomized controlled trial of simple source credibility labels embedded in users' social feeds and search results pages. Combining surveys and digital trace data from a subset of respondents, we find that after three weeks of embedded source contextual information, real-world exposure to low-quality news sources decreased by nearly 36\%, and the perceived accuracy of popular misinformation spread about the Black Lives Matter movement and Covid-19 also measurably declined. Unlike some other strategies to counteract misperceptions, our intervention seemed to achieve these effects without reducing the perceived accuracy of true information. Finally, the intervention led to increased trust in the mainstream media, raising the possibility of a self-sustaining cycle of improved news diets and more positive attitudes toward credible news outlets.

##Instructions:

(1) Open the R Project and make sure the the two files of code are loaded:
-Figures_in_Main_Paper.R
-Figures_Tables_In_Appendix.R

There are four directories:

(1) Code: In the code directory there lies two R files that produce important figures and tables in the main document and the supplementary methods and materials:

(1.1) Figures_in_Main_Paper.R: Produces figures for the main paper.

(1.2) Figures_Tables_In_Appendix.R: Produces tables figures and tables for the supplementary materials and methods.

(2) Data: Contains all data needed to 

(3) Figures: All the figures produced by the two R files in the code directory are located here.

(4) Tables: All the tables (in .txt files) produced by the two R files in the code directory are located here.

(5) Codebooks: All the codebooks are located here for the raw data from YouGov are located here:
