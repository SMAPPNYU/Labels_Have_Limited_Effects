# Abstract: 

As the primary arena for viral misinformation shifts toward transnational threats such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the search continues for scalable, lasting countermeasures compatible with principles of transparency and free expression. To advance scientific understanding and inform future interventions, we conducted a randomized field experiment evaluating the impact of source credibility labels embedded in users' social feeds and search results pages. By combining representative surveys (N = 3,337) and digital trace data ($N = 946$) from a subset of respondents, we provide a rare ecologically valid test of such an intervention on both attitudes and behavior. On average across the sample, we are unable to detect changes in real-world consumption of news from low-quality sources after three weeks, and we can rule out even small effects on perceived accuracy of popular misinformation spread about the Black Lives Matter movement and Covid-19. However, we present suggestive evidence of a substantively meaningful increase in news diet quality among the heaviest consumers of misinformation in our sample. We discuss the implications of our findings for practical questions about designing interventions to counteract online misinformation.
